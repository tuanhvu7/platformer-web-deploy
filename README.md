* Player can jump indefinently off of vertical surfaces
* Yellow block is checkpoint
* Tall gray block is goal
* Small gray block with a colored number on it is a health item
* Press **p** mid-level to pause

## Menu
* Press **u** on the level select menu to go to the player control config menu
* Press **l** on the player control config menu to go to the level select menu
* Press **c** on the level select menu switch between start at beginning (green panel) and start at checkpoint (peach panel) of level
* Note: **u, l, p, c** are reserved keys; you cannot set the controls to these keys

## Hints
- Think outside the box
### Level 1
- In the beginning, there are a large number of small enemies in a row for a reason. How does having a lot of enemies in a row differ from having a few enemies in a row?
### Level 2
- Something is wrong if the level seems straightforward
### Level 3
- After the checkpoint, the big invincible enemy that falls down from the sky may cause issues later on. There is a way to prevent that enemy from falling completely to the ground
